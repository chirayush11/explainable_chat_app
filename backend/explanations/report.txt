================================================================================
3. ANSWERING USER QUESTIONS
================================================================================

WHY did the model predict -2.04 hours?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The prediction was primarily driven by:
  • Weight <= 69.00 (value: N/A) decreased the prediction by 23.1816 hours
  • Disciplinary failure <= 0.00 (value: N/A) increased the prediction by 18.9446 hours
  • Weight (value: 69.0) decreased the prediction by 9.5452 hours
  • Body mass index (value: 24.0) increased the prediction by 8.5711 hours
  • 23.00 < Body mass index <= 25.00 (value: N/A) increased the prediction by 8.5001 hours


WHY NOT a different value?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The model didn't predict a higher/lower value because:
  • Some features pushed the prediction UP: Disciplinary failure <= 0.00, Body mass index, 23.00 < Body mass index <= 25.00
  • Other features pulled it DOWN: Weight <= 69.00, Weight
  • The final prediction (-2.04 hours) is the net result


WHAT IF we changed feature values?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Based on the model coefficients, changing features would have these effects:

4. KEY INSIGHTS FOR USERS
================================================================================

GLOBAL INSIGHTS:
• The model identifies Body mass index as the most important 
  global driver of absenteeism predictions.
• The top 5 features together explain a significant portion of the model's decisions.
• Features with positive coefficients increase predicted absenteeism, while negative 
  coefficients decrease it.

LOCAL INSIGHTS (for this instance):
• The prediction of -2.04 hours was primarily driven by 
  Weight <= 69.00 (-23.1816 hours contribution).
• The model's reasoning aligns with the feature values: this instance has specific 
  characteristics that led to this prediction.
• The error of 3.04 hours 
  suggests the model is reasonably accurate for this type of case.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Use these explanations to understand model trustworthiness.
• Consider the top features when making decisions about workplace policies.
• Remember: predictions are estimates, not certainties.
• Check fairness metrics to ensure the model treats all groups fairly.
